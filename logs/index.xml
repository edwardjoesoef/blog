I’m trying to build a hobby project using these technologies again. Last time, I created a simple UI to call the Pokemon Trading Card API. This time, I’m trying to build a full-stack project using PERN (Postgresql, Express, React, and Node JS). It seems like my skills have gotten a bit rusty, so I’ve been stuck on localhost for a while. The last time I built a full-stack project was during my Fintech course, where I built one using the typical MERN stack. That time, I built on a Windows machine.

But I’m really hoping this one lasts longer than my past attempts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now, I plan to use this platform as my personal blog to keep track of things I’m doing to grow and pursue my passions. I hope I have more time to do this time around!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned and thanks for visiting!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
